## Why this fork ?

I wanted to have a language analyzer toolkit that made use of Transformer(and preferably, adapters) - and then I came across Trankit. But, more than the annotated features, I was more interested in the rich embeddings that each module produced. These embedding features(and the actual linguistic features) I believe are really important to guide system toward better language understanding.

I could've made a toolkit by hand, but this fork actually really works, so why not??
